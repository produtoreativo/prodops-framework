# FINISH

Use this skill to close a task with explicit quality evidence.

## Inputs

- `AGENTS.md`
- `prodops/journeys/delivery/phases/finish/quality-gates.md`
- `prodops/journeys/delivery/phases/finish/done-criteria.md`
- Current diff and test output

## Flow

1. Review changed files and confirm scope.
2. Check quality gates relevant to the task.
3. Run targeted validation and broader validation when risk warrants it.
4. Confirm ProdOps artifacts were updated only where impacted.
5. Confirm Release Trail evidence exists.
6. Leave explicit next steps for any incomplete item.

## Guardrails

- Do not mark work complete without evidence.
- Do not hide skipped tests; record why they were skipped.
- Do not expand scope during finish work.
